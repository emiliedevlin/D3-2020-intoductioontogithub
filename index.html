  <div class="textfox"  <p>

  A Fox fell into a well and was unable to get out again. By and by a
  thirsty Goat came by, and seeing the Fox in the well asked him if the
  water was good. "Good?" said the Fox, "it's the best water I ever
  tasted in all my life. Come down and try it yourself." The Goat
  thought of nothing but the prospect of quenching his thirst, and

  jumped in at once. When he had had enough to drink, he looked about,
  like the Fox, for some way of getting out, but could find none.
  Presently the Fox said, "I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs,
  and plant your forelegs firmly against the side of the well, and then
  I'll climb on to your back, and, from there, by stepping on your

  horns, I can get out. And when I'm out, I'll help you out too." The
  Goat did as he was requested, and the Fox climbed on to his back and
  so out of the well; and then he coolly walked away. The Goat called
  loudly after him and reminded him of his promise to help him out: but
  the Fox merely turned and said, "If you had as much sense in your head

  as you have hair in your beard you wouldn't have got into the well
  without making certain that you could get out again."

    A Dog and a Sow were arguing and each claimed that its own young ones<br>
were finer than those of any other animal. "Well," said the Sow at <br>
last, "mine can see, at any rate, when they come into the world: but <br>
yours are born blind."<br>
